# Installation

To use Toucan in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm add @crowdstrike/ember-toucan-core

## Setup Tailwind

Toucan is built using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). 
CrowdStrike has built a few other open source packages to assist with using our Tailwind configuration. 
It is recommended to follow [the instructions for ember-toucan-styles](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/ember-toucan-styles#setup) to finish setup of your Ember application.
