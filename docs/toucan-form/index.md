# Toucan Form

Want to use Toucan Core components with forms without having to build the form logic yourself? The Toucan Form add-on uses [ember-headless-form](https://ember-headless-form.pages.dev/) and provides yielded Toucan Core components so you can spend less time building form logic and more time using our building blocks to build features.

## Installation

To use Toucan Forms in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm add @crowdstrike/ember-toucan-form
# or
yarn add @crowdstrike/ember-toucan-form
# or
npm install @crowdstrike/ember-toucan-form
# or
ember install @crowdstrike/ember-toucan-form
```

If you haven't already, please follow the [installation instructions](../installation.md) for Toucan Core.
