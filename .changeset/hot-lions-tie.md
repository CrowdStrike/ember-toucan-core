'@crowdstrike/ember-toucan-core': patch
---

Added the `@isReadOnly` component argument to all form components. It will apply read only styling and the `readonly` attribute. This requires the latest release of [@crowdstrike/tailwind-toucan-base](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/tailwind-toucan-base/releases/tag/%40crowdstrike%2Ftailwind-toucan-base%403.5.0).
